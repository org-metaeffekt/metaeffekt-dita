    <glossdef>
        There are various cases where a component is made available by a provider under multiple licenses.
        The effective licenses are selected licenses relevant for redistribution.
        <ul>
            <li>A component is provided with a dual or multiple licensing option where either one or the other license
            can be used for redistribution. In this case a single effective license needs to be determined.</li>
            <li>A component is provided with a license in a specific or later version. In this case a version of
            the license has to be selected as effective license.</li>
            <li>For a component, which contains subcomponents the license of the component and the individual licenses
                of the subcomponents are effective.</li>
        </ul>
