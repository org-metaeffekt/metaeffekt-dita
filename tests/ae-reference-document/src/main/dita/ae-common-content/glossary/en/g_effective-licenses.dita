    <glossterm>Effective Licenses</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
        There are various cases where a component is made available by a provider under multiple associated licenses.
        The effective licenses are the selected licenses relevant for the software distribution:
        <ul>
            <li>A component is provided with a dual or multiple licensing option where either one or the other
                license can be used for distribution. In this case a single effective license needs to be determined.</li>
            <li>A component is provided with a license in a specific or later version. In this case a version of the
                license has to be selected as effective license.</li>
            <li>For a component, which contains subcomponents the license of the component and the individual licenses
                of the subcomponents are effective.</li>
            <li>The associated license of a component allows to sublicense the component under a different license. In
                this case the chosen license is the effective license.</li>
        </ul>
