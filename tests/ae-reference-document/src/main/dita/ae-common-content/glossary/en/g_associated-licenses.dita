    <glossdef>An artifact can be distributed by a provider under different licenses depending on the context or the
        channels in which the artifact is made available or transferred. These licenses are associated with the
        artifact when downloading or receiving the artifact and are referred to as associated licenses. In contrast to
        the associated licenses, the effective licenses are the licenses under which the artifact is further
        distributed. The associated and effective licenses of an artifact can differ, but are restricted by the terms
        of the associated licenses.
