    <title>References</title>
    <body>
        <p>When writing DITA content it is possible to use all kinds of references. For example it
            is possible to point to a link in the web using a href. For example <xref
                href="metaeffekt.org" format="org" scope="external"/>. You can also point to another
            chapter. For example <xref
                href="../../introduction/en/tpc_introduction.dita#tpc_introduction"/>.</p>
        <p> Really useful are key-based references (keyref). Basically you use an alias for the
            reference. This alias must be mapped within the ditamap. For example <xref
                keyref="introduction"/>. This can be explicitly useful when content is made
            reusable. The reusable piece want's to introduce a reference. But the reference is
            dangling until the content is reused in a ditamap. Then the reference must of course
            exist. The ditamap has to specify how the link is to be resolved.</p>
