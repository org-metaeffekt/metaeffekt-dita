    <title>Introduction</title>
    <body>
        <p> Getting started with <abbreviated-form keyref="dita"/> and the <abbreviated-form
                keyref="ditaot"/> is quite a challenge. Advantages over other documentation
            approaches can only be achieved once a complete infrastructure - a tool chain - is
            defined, established, and constantly managed. </p>
        <p>This document is part of the {met√¶ffekt} DITA Tool Chain. It demonstrates how content can
            be organized and transformed to different outputs, such as <abbreviated-form
                keyref="html5"/> and <abbreviated-form keyref="PDF"/>. </p>
        <p>The content of this document is used as reference to demonstrate the features and
            capabilities of the tool chain. As such the content is often artificial. </p>
        <p>This short introduction already illustrates the power<indexterm>Power</indexterm> of the
            toolchain to a great extend. Mind the references to the glossary. The glossary is
            context specific to the document that is produced and based on existing term
            definitions.</p>
        <p>Glossary terms use key references. This means a reference that does not point directly to
            an existing file, but an identifier (key) that is then mapped to a file from the
            ditamap.</p>
