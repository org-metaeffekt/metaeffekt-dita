        <p>The {metæffekt} DITA Tool Chain envisions to lower the hurdle for an organization to
            access a consistent and conceptually sound configuration that can be adapted to
            ogranization-specific requirements more easily.</p>
        <p>Once the fundamentals are established the tool chain can be integrated deeper in the
            procedure and processes of the organization. By generating DITA content from other
            sources such as a issue tracker,  development resources (such as Maven POMs or other
            project definitions) generated content can be integrated into the documents.</p>
        <p>The ultimate goal of the {metæffekt} DITA Tool Chain is to automate the complete release
            documentation of a software development project. This supports incremental software
            development approaches.</p>
