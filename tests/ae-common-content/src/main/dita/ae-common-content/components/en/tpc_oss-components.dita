    <title>Open Source Components</title>
    <body>
        <p>
            In general, for each and every open source component the individual terms and conditions of the associated 
            license apply. The licensee of an open source component is granted a non-exclusive right of use by the 
            respective right holders restricted by the stipulated terms and conditions defined in the associated 
            license. In particular, liability and warranty regulations of the individual open source license apply 
            only in relation to the respective right holder.
        </p>
        <p>
            The license files and notice files of the effective open source licenses are provided as extended scope
            of the software delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
            License obligations of the individual open source components, as far as these can be addressed in 
            documentation, are detailed in section <xref keyref="license-notices"/>. In case a 
            license demands the provision of source code for a component, the source is made available by adding the 
            source artifacts to the extended scope of the software delivery or by making the source available as
            individually outlined in <xref keyref="license-notices"/>.
